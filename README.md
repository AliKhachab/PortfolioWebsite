# Portfolio Website Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) made using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React. This is my first ever web-development project. Note that the "Contact me" section will not work on GitHub since I do not have an API key linked to the public repository. If you would actually like to contact me, you can use the email listed above the contact form or head to the [actual portfolio website](https://aliikhachabportfolio.vercel.app/).
