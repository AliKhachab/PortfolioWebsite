# Portfolio Website Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) made using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React. This is my first ever web-development project. I'll be customizing this as I go on and learn more. Video I'm basing this portfolio site off of is by YouTuber and programmer [ByteGrad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUKptmUVIBM&ab_channel=ByteGrad) (video attached).
